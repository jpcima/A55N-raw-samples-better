Yamaha A55N samples

These are organ samples taken of all the keys of all individual tone registers.
In addition, there are recordings of rhythms, vibrato, and others things.

The raw tones are recorded approximately like this: key down 3s, up 1s
There is a noise recording, to be used by Audacity or similar tools for noise removal.

These recording are taken from the AUX OUT plug and into the M-Audio Fast Track Ultra,
which provides the least noisy output.

The organ was not fully-working, so at least the following are missing:
- upper manual presets: piano, guitar, vibraphone
- rhythms: samba1
